The Linux boot process is what loads the Kernel and the computer. For simplicity, we will describe the booting process on a Linux machine with BIOS and MBR.

The process starts with the loading of the [[BIOS]]. Then, the BIOS find the [[MBR]] and in it finds the [[Boot Loader|stage 1 boot loader]]. The stage 1 boot loader finds and executes the [[Boot Loader#Stage 2|stage 2 boot loader]]. The boot loader usually loads and early user-space called [[initrd]] or [[initramfs]] in more modern Linux systems, and loads the [[Linux Kernel]] which comes precompiled with the things needed to run the early user-space. After that, the system executes a switch root or pivot root operation, which is similar to a chroot but without leaving trace or holding memory for the previous root.
