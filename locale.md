Localization are means of adapting computer sofware to different languages, regional peculiarities and technical requirements of a target locale.

Localization often includes but is not limited to:

1. Fonts
2. Input Methods
3. Keyboard Layouts
4. Languages
5. Date Formats
6. Money Formats

In Linux, the locale can be queried by the command `locale` and in debian the package for localization is called `locales`. It can be configured with `dpkg-reconfigure locales`.
