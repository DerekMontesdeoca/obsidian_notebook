Medium access control address or media access control address is a unique identifier assigned to a network interface controller (NIC). They are represented as six groups of two hex digits, separated by hyphens, colons, or without a separator. MAC addresses are hard-coded into the network interfaces, but some interfaces provide ways to change the MAC address. Additionally, virtual interfaces may get MAC addresses assigned randomly by default.

Since MAC addresses can be effectively spoofed, it is not secure to restrict devices with a firewall by MAC address.
