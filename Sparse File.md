sparse files are an intrinsic feature of the Linux Virtual File System ([[VFS]]). They are an optimization that allow for "holes" to exist in files that require a certain size but not all of it is populated. Instead of allocating the extra size, the vfs creates a virtual hole that returns 0s if read from. In the case of writing, this space is allocated and written to. Different modules exist for different filesystems to support sparse files.
