A firewall is a security system that monitors, controls, and filters incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predefined security rules. 

Firewalls can be programs or hardware, they can be on networks, computers, or on clouds, and they can be stateful or stateless.

Stateful firewalls inspect all the packets and its contents and remember connections in order to make decisions about what to allow, filter, or deny. Stateless firewalls only inspect the packet headers against predefined rules to make decisions.
