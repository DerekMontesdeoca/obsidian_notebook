Acts like a buffer for current. Works by creating energy potential between . The electrons accumulate on one side and when a path is formed that can make the electrons move from one side to another, the capacitor releases its charge. 

# Applications

- Smoothing out peaks in input.
- Converting AC current into DC current.
- Filtering electring noise.
- Providing stability on the output.

Capacitors are dangerous and should always be treated as if they're charged.
