Show and manipulate routing, network devices, interfaces and tunnels.

Right now, I'm not familiar with how to use the manipulation commands, so I'm going to take notes on how to use the show commands.

# Show commands

## link

`ip link show` outputs the information of network devices. Values include the device, its status, and its [[MAC address]].

## address

`ip addr show` outputs the information of protocol (IP (4)) or (IPv6) address on a device. Values include the device with its ip address and if the device is up, down, or unknown.
