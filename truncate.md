Shrinks and extends file size. If the file is shrunk, the additional data is lost. If the file is extended, the additional hole is virtual. No actual space is allocated and reading from it returns 0s. Once you write to the unallocated portion, the space starts to become allocated and written to. This is known as a [[Sparse File|sparse file]]. If the filesystem doesn't support sparse files, the files is actually zeroed.
