Password expiry on Linux is handled by many different systems. The first system, [[/etc/login.defs]], handles defaults for expiration, warning age, and min days before being allowed to change passwd. These don't modify existing users but instead handles rules for password expiration on user creation. The next system, [[command chage]], is for changing the user password expiry information of already created users. This command handles everything for already created users regarding password expiry. Finally, the conf files for useradd, handle some settings like inactive users after some period of having their passwords expired.
