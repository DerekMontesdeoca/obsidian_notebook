A filesystem is a format for storing and accessing data within a storage unit. Different filesystems provide unique tradeoffs that need to be evaluated according to the requirements of data access, modification, available storage and computing speed. 

In Linux filesystems are created with mkfs command, and the storage must not be [[mount|mounted]]. A filesystem can also be created within a file or image and can be accessed via a loopback device.

Most common filesystems are NTFS, EXT4, FAT, ZFS, etc.
