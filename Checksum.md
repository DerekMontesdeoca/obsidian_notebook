Checksums are small blocks of data computed from data for the purpose of detecting errors that happened on storage or during transmission. Checksums are computed by checksum algorithms. It is desirable that checksum algorithms produce big differences on the checksum result when small differences are detected. Usually checksums are computed by deriving blocks of data to which cryptographic or hash functions are applied to get the result. The simplest method of creating a checksum is by using the [[Longitudinal Parity Check]].
