Usually found at /proc, it is a special "pseudo" filesystem which provides an interface to the kernel internal data structures. Most of these files are RO, but some are editable, allowing for changes in the data structures of the kernel. In order to [[mount]] the proc filesystem, you must use the -t proc option. You can learn more about proc doing man proc. One of the most important aspects of proc, is that information about each process is held on /proc/\[pid].
